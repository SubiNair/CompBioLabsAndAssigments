## Exposure to pesticides impairs the ability of bumblebees to forage for pollen

### Question
#### Can we predict how bumblebee foraging is affected by exposure to pesticides? 

### Introduction
Bumblebees are incredibly important to their ecosystems. They are key pollinators and are responsible for pollinating many of our staple crops. The use of certain insecticides to kill pests also affects the bees who share their habitat. 
The pesticides we put into our environment have a direct effect on our ecosystems and the growing rate of bumblebee death is just an example of that.

### Methods
##### Data Source
The data was generated in the paper "Chronic impairment of bumblebee natural foraging behaviour induced by sublethal pesticide exposure" by Richard J. Gill and Nigel E. Raine. The experiment involved 4 different pesticide treatments being tested on Bombus terrestris (bumblebees) to determine the deteriorating effects over time on foraging behaviors and learning. 

The [publication can be found here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12292/full) and the data is in [the dryad repository](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.kv558)

The data was produced by taking bees from several colonies and exposing them to specific treatments. The bees were then measured over a span of roughly two months on their ability to forage effectively for pollen. This included how long they stayed out, and how much pollen they carried back with them, as well as the type of pollen they carried with them. 

The data was contained in two .xlsx files, one for Foraging Data which was 98.22 Kb, and one for pollen data which was 47.17 Kb. 

##### Original Study
The foraging data was used to create regression models on how often bees would forage and how many bees would forage if still alive after exposure. They also used the pollen data to produce analyses on 

##### My Project and Analysis 
I recreated some of the original analyses, by creating regressions based on the average number of foraging bouts per day and the average pollen score per day for each of the treatments. I also created barplots of the bees flower preferences with each treatment. 

I also did some of my own Poisson distribution analysis by using the dpois function in R to model the exact probabilities of a bumblebee bringing back a certain amount of pollen for each of the treatments.  The researchers had used a Poisson distribution to model the number of foragers and the foraging bouts but they didn't apply the model to the pollen data, which is what I was more focused on for this project. 

### Results and Conclusions
The treatments are listed as A, B, C, D, which denote the LC (Î»-cyhalothrin), M (The mix of the two), The Control, and I (imidacloprid) respectively. 

What I found through my Poisson distribution analysis was that for the treatments B and D, the probability of a bee bringing back a moderate to high pollen load plummeted. Pollen load is relative to the size of the bee and what this indicates is, during the observed time period, a bee that has received either one of these treatments has great difficulty carrying a sufficient amount of pollen. Both of these treatments contain imidacloprid.

This is strong additional evidence to suggest that imidacloprid specifically harms bees ability to forage effectively. ## Exposure to pesticides impairs the ability of bumblebees to forage for pollen
