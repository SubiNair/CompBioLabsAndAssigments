Pokemon Pokeball Cookies â€” Recipe from Nerdy Nummies/Rosanna Pansino (YouTube)

YOU WILL NEED: 

1 cup unsalted butter
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
Red Gel Food Coloring
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 and 1/2 cups cups Flour
1 and 1/4 cups Powdered Sugar
1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons regular sugar
Black frosting and smarties (or marshmallows) to decorate

Take flour, salt, baking soda, and mix together. Then in another bowl mix butter, powdered sugar, regular sugar, and then beat until creamy. Then add 1 egg, and vanilla extract into the butter mixture. Now gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the butter mixture. and mix together. 
Now once all of it has been mixed together, take half of the dough and dye it red. 
Now refrigerate dough to make it fairly firm (about an hour). After the dough has cooled, roll the dough into logs (freeze if needed). Cut the logs/cylinders down the middle lengthwise. Now match up the red halves with white halves (use egg wash to help them stick if needed). Freeze to allow them to stick.
Once they have stuck, we can use a large cutting knife to slice along the logs into circles (we you want them to be perfect, we can use a circular cookie cutter to get rid of the uneven edges).

Heat oven to 375 F and bake for 7-9 minutes. 

Now decorate to look like poke balls. Place candy, or marshmallow, in middle with frosting, and frost around so they look like poke balls.
